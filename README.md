# census_R
Brief explainer for loading and using Census data in R. This page has a simple explainer to load and manipulate Census and ACS data for equity analyses and other population/demographic related analyses. 

### Accessing Census Handout
This is a basic explainer for using some of the most common functions for the most common R Census packages. I find it useful when I've forgotten how something works and I need a quick refresher, but it's also useful for learning for the first time.

### Tidycensus.R
This is a useful tutorial from https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/tidycensus.html. You can use it to learn how to create maps from census data, load ACS data, and manipulate it for your purposes.

### Simple Example
This is a simple example I made using tidycensus to load ACS 5 year data for population by age by census tract for Baltimore. You can use this as a template when you're creating a new analysis. In it, I use the data to create a table of population by age group, but you can change that to any other category that would be useful.
